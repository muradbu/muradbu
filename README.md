I'm a tech enthusiast and I namely love keeping up with Linux developments. NixOS is my favorite distro and I've nixified my entire stack, from my MacBook Pro to my VM's and servers. My [dotfiles](github.com/muradbu/dotfiles) is a forever work-in-progress and my passion project. Other than that I enjoy self-hosting and discovering cool new apps to self-host, reading HackerNews and Phoronix. Other than tech, I really enjoy coffee, writing, (making) music and films.
